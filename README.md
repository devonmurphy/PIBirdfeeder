#PI BIRD FEEDER
The goal of this project is to make a bird feeder that takes pictures of the birds as they fly up to eat. Currently the project uses one PIR sensor to detect if a bird is in the feeder or not. When the bird is detected, a picture is taken and is saved to an Apache website. You can access these by typing in the IP of your Raspberry Pi in your browser as long as you are connected on the same network.
